description: "Spatially subset a weather-skills standard dataset Zarr to a lat/lon bbox, named country (--region), or GeoJSON polygon. Use when you need to restrict any dataset (forecast, satellite, reanalysis, stations) before downstream aggregation or plotting. --region / --geojson keep every grid cell that overlaps the polygon, including cells that straddle the country boundary."

# clip-region

Source-agnostic spatial subset. Pass an explicit `--bbox`, `--region` (ISO3 /
country name / named region), or a `--geojson` polygon. `--region` and
`--geojson` keep every grid cell whose footprint overlaps the polygon —
including cells that straddle the country boundary. `--bbox` still slices
by cell-center coordinates.

## When to use

- Narrowing a continental grid down to one country for plotting or per-country reporting.
- Clipping a gridded or station dataset to a custom polygon.
- Applying a custom bbox to any gridded dataset before further processing.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clip.py --input <in.zarr> --output <out.zarr> \
    --bbox N/W/S/E

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clip.py --input <in.zarr> --output <out.zarr> \
    --region Kenya

uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clip.py --input <in.zarr> --output <out.zarr> \
    --geojson boundary.geojson [--keep-outside]
```

### Arguments
- `--input`, `-i` — input Zarr (gridded/spatial or point_obs).
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr.
- `--bbox` — `N/W/S/E` in decimal degrees. Mutex with `--geojson` and
  `--region`. Slices by cell-center coordinates.
- `--region` — ISO3, country name, or named region (same lookup as
  `resolve-region`). Clips to the boundary polygon and keeps every grid cell
  that overlaps it, including cells that straddle the border. Mutex
  with `--bbox` and `--geojson`.
- `--geojson` — path to a GeoJSON Feature/FeatureCollection/geometry. Mutex
  with `--bbox` and `--region`. Same cell-overlap rule as `--region`.
- `--keep-outside` — with `--geojson` or `--region`: set values outside the
  polygon to NaN instead of dropping cells/stations.

### Longitude convention

Longitudes in `[0, 360]` are auto-wrapped to `[-180, 180]` before clipping, so a global grid stored in the `[0, 360]` convention still intersects bboxes/polygons that use negative lon.

### Output

A spatial subset of the input Zarr with provenance history stamped.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr: an append-only array
of per-step entries `{skill, version, args, input}`. This skill reads the
upstream input's `weather_skills_history` (default `[]` and stderr warning if absent)
and appends its own entry. `args` is the argparse namespace minus the
`--input`/`--output` path strings; `input` is a `{basename, hash}` dict —
`basename` is the upstream zarr's filename and `hash` is a sha256 of its
stored bytes; `version` is the `_SKILL_VERSION` constant in `scripts/clip.py`.

The `args` dict stores argparse dest names (underscored), not the hyphenated CLI
flag names. A consumer reconstructing a
`uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/<skill>.py <args>` invocation must
translate underscore → hyphen.

## Example

```bash
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clip.py -i /tmp/ecmwf.zarr -o /tmp/ecmwf_kenya.zarr --region Kenya

# Station / TAHMO point_obs: keeps stations whose lat/lon coords fall in the box
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/clip.py -i /tmp/tahmo.zarr -o /tmp/tahmo_mombasa.zarr \
    --bbox -3.92/39.57/-4.16/39.76
```
