description: Compute a standardized anomaly (z-score) — (ds[var] - clim[var_avg]) / clim[var_std] — for one or more --variable names, given a data Zarr and a climatology Zarr (e.g. from clim-fetch) with matching dims. Dimensionless output, refuses (does not just warn) on units mismatch between the field and its climatology. Use for anomaly detection, SPI/SPEI-style standardized indices, or comparing a value's unusualness across variables/locations on the same scale. Not for a plain physical-unit anomaly (field minus mean, no division) — use difference for that.

# standardize-anomaly

Computes a **standardized anomaly** — the z-score of a field against a
climatology's mean and spread — not a plain physical-unit anomaly. The two
are genuinely different quantities:

- **Anomaly**: `field − mean`. Still in the field's original units (a
  temperature anomaly in °C, a precip anomaly in mm/day). Already covered by
  `difference` (subtract a climatology mean from a field).
- **Standardized anomaly / z-score**: `(field − mean) / std`. Dimensionless.
  The basis for indices like SPI/SPEI. What this skill computes.

For each `--variable NAME`, reads `NAME` from `--input` and `NAME_avg` /
`NAME_std` from `--climatology` (e.g. `clim-fetch`'s own output naming),
aligns them (xarray inner join on shared dims, same as `difference`), and
writes `NAME_anomaly`.

## When to use

- Anomaly detection: how unusual is today's value relative to this
  day-of-year's typical mean and spread?
- Standardized indices (SPI/SPEI-style): needs the climatology's mean *and*
  std, not mean alone.
- Comparing unusualness across variables or locations on one common,
  dimensionless scale (a z-score of +2 means the same thing for precip in
  Nairobi as for temperature in Lagos; a plain anomaly in mm/day and one in
  °C do not compare at all).

Not for a plain physical-unit anomaly — use `difference` with a mean-only
baseline for that; no division, output keeps the field's original units.

## Usage

```
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/standardize_anomaly.py \
  --input <ds.zarr> --climatology <clim.zarr> --variable NAME [--variable NAME ...] \
  --output <out.zarr>
```

### Arguments

- `--input`, `-i` — the data Zarr (e.g. an observation or forecast field).
- `--climatology` — the climatology Zarr, carrying `NAME_avg`/`NAME_std` for
  every `--variable` requested (e.g. `clim-fetch`'s output).
- `--variable`, `-v` — repeatable, **required** (no default — unlike
  `difference`, there's no "variables shared by both inputs" to fall back to,
  since the climatology's own variable names are `NAME_avg`/`NAME_std`, not
  `NAME`). Each name must be a data variable of `--input`, and both
  `NAME_avg` and `NAME_std` must be data variables of `--climatology`. All
  requested variables are checked against both inputs up front, in one pass —
  a violation on any of them exits non-zero listing everything missing from
  each side at once, not just the first problem found.
- `--output`, `-o` — output Zarr.

### Alignment

Same as `difference`: an xarray-aligned inner join on shared dims (e.g.
`time`, `lat`, `lon`), broadcasting over dims present on only one side. A
`--climatology` at a coarser resolution than `--input` (e.g. `clim-fetch
--window 7`) still works — the climatology's fewer, coarser-grained days just
align to whichever `--input` days share the exact same coordinate value.

Before aligning, if **both** `--input` and `--climatology` have a spatial dim
(detected via `detect_spatial_dims`, the same CF-metadata/name-based lookup
used elsewhere in this ecosystem — neither input is required to have one, two
plain time series work fine), each is renamed onto `latitude`/`longitude` on
both sides regardless of what either one originally called it (e.g.
`--input`'s `latitude` and `--climatology`'s `lat` both become `latitude` —
otherwise xarray broadcasts them as two unrelated dims instead of aligning,
growing the output's dimensionality instead of computing a real anomaly);
then cast to `float64` and rounded to 4 decimal places on both sides. Without
the rounding, two sources on "the same" grid but stored with different
coordinate dtypes (`float32` vs `float64`) can fail xarray's exact-equality
alignment on some cells but not others — not an error, just a
silently smaller-than-expected, still-plausible-looking output. `time` isn't
touched by either step (no naming synonyms to resolve, and it's `datetime64`,
not exposed to the float32/float64 problem).

### Units

Both sides are pint-quantified on open, so unit compatibility is checked by
pint itself, not by comparing `units` strings: dimensionally compatible but
differently-scaled units (`mm/day` vs `cm/day`) are converted and combined
correctly, automatically. A genuine mismatch (e.g. `mm/day` vs
`degree_Celsius`) **errors** — this is stricter than `difference`, which only
warns on a `units` mismatch and proceeds. The reason: a difference with
mismatched units is wrong-scale but still a coherent number; a z-score built
from mismatched units isn't a valid ratio at all, so proceeding would produce
a number that looks fine but means nothing.

### Output

One `NAME_anomaly` variable per `--variable`, dimensionless (`units: "1"`),
`long_name` set to `"NAME standardized anomaly"`. The field's own `units`
and other attrs are **not** copied — unlike `difference`, which keeps the
first input's attrs (appropriate there since a difference of two rates is
still a rate; a z-score isn't a rate at all, so nothing physical carries
over). If a spatial dim was present, its output name is always
`latitude`/`longitude` regardless of what either input called it — see
"Alignment" above. A cell where `NAME_std` is exactly `0` (e.g. a bone-dry
precip window with no historical variability) has an undefined z-score and
is masked to `NaN` rather than a division artifact.

### Provenance

The output stamps a JSON-encoded `weather_skills_history` attr, same shape as
`difference`'s: entry `input` is a list with one item per input (`--input`
then `--climatology`), each carrying that input's own upstream chain.
Inspect with the `provenance` skill.

## Example

```bash
# Standardize today's IMERG precip against its day-of-year climatology.
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/standardize_anomaly.py \
  --input /tmp/imerg_today.zarr --climatology /tmp/imerg_clim.zarr \
  --variable precip --output /tmp/precip_zscore.zarr

# Two variables in one call.
uv run ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/scripts/standardize_anomaly.py \
  --input /tmp/era5_today.zarr --climatology /tmp/era5_clim.zarr \
  --variable precip --variable t2m --output /tmp/zscores.zarr
```

### Recipe: standardizing a weekly total against its climatology

`--climatology` doesn't have to be daily — a `--climatology` built at a
coarser resolution than `--input` still aligns fine (see "Alignment" above).
To standardize an observed weekly rainfall *total* against its climatological
weekly-total mean/std, build the climatology side with `clim-fetch`'s own
"weekly accumulation climatology" recipe (`clim-fetch --window 7` → `select`
→ `convert-to-totals`; see `clim-fetch`'s SKILL.md), then feed the result
here as `--climatology` alongside a matching `--input` (e.g. CHIRPS weekly
totals from `chirps-fetch` + `select` + `convert-to-totals`).
